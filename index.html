            <h1>Hi! I'm Vince Michael Dizon</h1>
            <p>I’m an aspiring web developer passionate about learning full-stack development. Currently exploring core technologies like <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>PHP</b> with a backend interest in <b>Java</b>.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I got inspired to pursue web development because of platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and online systems such as e-commerce websites. Seeing how these technologies work—how they're connected through the internet—sparked a deep curiosity in me.</p>

            <p>What really pushed me to become a web developer was my interest in how <b>systems</b> and <b>games</b> are made. I often found myself wondering: <b>"How does this work?"</b> or <b>"How is this built?"</b> That curiosity led me to take a course related to computers and technology.</p>
                
            <p>But it was during the second year of my course when programming truly caught my attention. I still remember the first time I wrote and compiled a piece of code. It was the classic "Hello, World!", and it marked the beginning of everything. That moment opened my eyes to what's possible with programming—creating systems, making games, solving problems—and from that point on, I started my journey into the programming world.</p>
